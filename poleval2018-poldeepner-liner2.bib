abstract = {In this paper we present a new approach to morphosyntactic tagging of Polish by bringing together Conditional Random Fields and tiered tagging. Our proposal also allows to take advantage of a rich set of morphological features, which resort to an external morphological analyser. The proposed algorithm is implemented as a tagger for Polish. Evaluation of the tagger shows significant improvement in tagging accuracy on two state-of-the-art taggers, namely PANTERA and WMBT.

@book{Marcinczuk2013,
abstract = {In the paper we present a customizable and open-source framework for proper names recognition called Liner2. The framework consists of several universal methods for sequence chunking which include: dictionary look-up, pattern matching and statistical processing. The statistical processing is performed using Conditional Random Fields and a rich set of features including morphological, lexical and semantic information. We present an application of the framework to the task of recognition proper names in Polish texts (5 common categories of proper names, i.e. first names, surnames, city names, road names and country names). The Liner2 framework was also used to train an extended model to recognize 56 categories of proper names which was used to bootstrap the manual annotation of KPWr corpus. We also present the CRF-based model integrated with a heterogeneous named entity similarity function. We show that the similarity function added to the best configuration improved the final result for cross-domain evaluation. The last section presents NER-WS-a web service for proper names recognition in Polish texts utilizing the Liner2 framework and the model for 56 categories of proper names. The web service can be tested using a web-based demo available at http://nlp.pwr.wroc.pl/inforex/. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@inproceedings{Marcinczuk2015,
abstract = {Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have been proven to be very useful in many sequence labelling tasks from the field of natural language processing, including named entity recognition (NER). The advantage of CRFs over other statistical models (like Hidden Markov Models) is that they can utilize a large set of features describing a sequence of observations. On the other hand, CRFs potential function is defined as a linear combination of features, what means, that it cannot model relationships between combinations of input features and output labels. This limitation can be overcome by defining the relationships between atomic features as complex features before training the CRFs. In the paper we present the experimental results of automatic generation of complex features for the named entity recognition task for Polish. A rule-induction algorithm called RIPPER is used to generate a set of rules which are latter transformed into a set of complex features. The extended set of features is used to train a CRFs model.},
